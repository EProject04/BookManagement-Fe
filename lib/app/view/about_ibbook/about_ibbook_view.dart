The project also organizes community activities to promote reading.This version is shorter because it removes some of the details that are not essential to the main points of the project. For example, it removes the phrase "by book lovers" from the first sentence, the phrase "with thousands of titles" from the second sentence, and the phrase "no registration or fee required" from the second sentence. It also removes the phrase "Let books pave the way on your journey to greater wisdom and understanding" from the fourth sentence, and the phrases "mainly focuses on Vietnamese books" and "to meet the needs of a wide range of readers" from the sixth sentence.',
